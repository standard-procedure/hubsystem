# Development Patterns

## Using OmniAuth in features
The Developer strategy is available in test mode and [feature tests](spec/turnip_helper.rb) are configured to [mock the OmniAuth provider](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth/wiki/Integration-Testing).  

To fake a login, find the relevant [user identity record](spec/fixtures/user_identities.yml) and add a mock authentication:

```ruby
OmniAuth.config.add_mock :developer, uid: @identity.uid
```

Then visit the log in page and click the "Developer login" button.  This will log in using the mock authentication and then redirect.

```ruby
visit some_path # If not logged in will redirect to new_session_path
click_on "Developer login" # Does a fake authentication
expect(page).to have_text "I am logged in"
```
